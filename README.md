### Github Pages
Github Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS and Javascript files from a repository on Github and publishes a website. Before we start, we have to fork the repository so that we can host the application on our site. After forking, click on the _Actions_ tab and enable workflows to run on the forked repositroy

The URL to your Github page should be: _https://\<your-github-username\>.github.io/ui-todo_
